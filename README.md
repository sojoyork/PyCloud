# Never run out of files by PyCloud!

PyCloud is a place with infinite storage of storing python files!

just type this in your terminal and boom!:
```sh
python3 PyCloud.py
```

If you are on windows then:
1. Install the [Installer](https://github.com/sojoyork/PyCloud/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

If you are on Linux/Unix then:
1. type `git clone https://github.com/sojoyork/PyCloud.git`.
2. Then type `cd PyCloud`
3. Then unzip the zipped folder using the  `installer.py` by `python3 installer.py`
4. Do whatever is in it
5. after it is unzipped go to the PyCloud folder (yes there is another folder named PyCloud in the PyCloud folder)
6. type `python3 PyCloud.py`
7. Enjoy

If you are on MacOS:
1. I don't know about MacOS :(
